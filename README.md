# Employee-Management-System
I developed a full-stack Employee Management System using Spring Boot and Maven. The system allows efficient management of employee records with features for adding, updating, and deleting data. It includes a user-friendly front-end and a scalable back-end, powered by Spring Boot, with Maven for project management and dependencies.
